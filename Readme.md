# Learning git

In this repository will have:
- Installable shellscripts and code/binaries commands to better handle git
  - both for Windows/Linux (and Mac?) and for Android Termux (and iSH?)
- Quick and adaptable tutorials for using Git (and so you can see that it's not as monstrous as you think...)

Stay tunned!
